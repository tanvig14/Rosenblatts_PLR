# Simple Implementation of Rosenblatt's Perceptron Learning Rule
This algorithm is for supervised learning of binary classifiers. It enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. 

My code takes 4 vectors as input as well as the desired output and learning rate. It then balances the weights and outputs the updated weights of each vector.
